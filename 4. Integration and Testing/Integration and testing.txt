4. Integration and Testing
1.	Integrate Frontend and Backend:
o	Use REST APIs in your React components to handle user registration and login.
o	Ensure that the frontend interacts correctly with the backend server.
2.	Testing:
o	Test the extension locally by loading it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
o	Test all functionalities including time tracking, website blocking, and 3D tree growth.
o	Test the backend server separately for authentication and data management.
3.	Deployment:
o	Package the Chrome extension and submit it to the Chrome Web Store.
o	Deploy the Node.js server using a service like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
By following these steps, you'll create a Google Chrome extension that helps users stay focused, manage their time, and overcome internet addiction while making the process engaging through interactive features and gamification.
